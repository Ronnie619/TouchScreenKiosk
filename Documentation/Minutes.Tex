\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 9/15/2015}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting went from 2:30pm - 4:30pm.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting began by catching Morgan up on what he missed at the team formation meeting the previous Thursday.
		\item Met with the Dean of Engineering to go over exactly what he wants the product to accomplish:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Must be cutting edge. It needs to really speak to the fact that you are entering the engineering college. It needs to be something that brings people to the building to see, like the Think Tank does.
				\item  Needs to provide a visually appealing, easy to understand interface that users can get important information from, such as campus maps, instructor information, past Deans, etc.
				\item Needs to somehow honor Dean Janssen, the father of the lady who is funding this project. Possibly incorporated into the name?
				\item Needs to be within a budget of roughly 6,000 to 10,000 dollars.
			\end{itemize}
		\item After the Dean left, we brainstormed ideas for the remainder of the time:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item What kind of app?
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Web-based? (HTML, CSS, JS, Python/PHP)
						\item Dedicated App coded in Java or C++?
					\end{itemize}
				\item What technology could we use?
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Projector with touch kiosk?
						\item Virtual Reality?
						\item Projector with Kinect to enable touch features?
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 9/22/2015}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting went from 2:30pm-3:30pm
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting began by discussing with Morgan our reservations with having a VR component in the project. 
		\item Morgan demonstrated some of the tech, however, and it was persusive. We decided to run the idea by 
		the dean at our next meeting, and see if he thinks it would be sufficient for what he's looking for. 
	\end{itemize}
	
\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 9/29/2015}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting went from 2:30 - 3:30
		\item Meeting was Joe and Ronnie looking up good projectors for this project, along with prices. 
		\item Joe found a fantastic short-throw projector that would be ideal for our purposes. Details are in the spec sheet. 
	
	\end{itemize}
	
\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 10/19/2015}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Meeting went from 2:30 - 3:30
	\item Meeting focused almost entirely on Joe and Ronnie having a conversation with the co-founder of UBI Interactive. 	\item As expected, UBI Interactive seems to be exactly the kind of thing we're looking for on this project. The demonstration went very well. UBI is fast, responsive, and easy to set-up and use. 
	\item After the conversation, Joe showed the team exactly where the screen would be installed. It will be on the eastern wall, because this wall already has convenient rear access via a service closet. 
	\end{itemize}
		
\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 11/2/2015}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting went from 2:30 - 3:30
		\item Joe updated us on the status of the Wiki. 
		\item Joe demonstrated some 3D menu ideas he's been toying around with. 
		\item We talked about how to best layout the screen as far as how many tiles, and decided it would be best to optimize the number and layout of the tiles to support up to 3 users. 
		\item Action items for this week are to come up with some potential art designs, to research the possibility of integrating Google Maps into our app, and to put more work into splitting the screen into multiple parts for multiple users.

\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 9/15/2105}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Meeting went from 2:30pm - 4:30pm.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting began by catching Morgan up on what he missed at the team formation meeting the previous Thursday.
		\item Met with the Dean of Engineering to go over exactly what he wants the product to accomplish:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Must be cutting edge. It needs to really speak to the fact that you are entering the engineering college. It needs to be something that brings people to the building to see, like the Think Tank does.
				\item  Needs to provide a visually appealing, easy to understand interface that users can get important information from, such as campus maps, instructor information, past Deans, etc.
				\item Needs to somehow honor Dean Janssen, the father of the lady who is funding this project. Possibly incorporated into the name?
				\item Needs to be within a budget of roughly 6,000 to 10,000 dollars.
			\end{itemize}
		\item After the Dean left, we brainstormed ideas for the remainder of the time:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item What kind of app?
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Web-based? (HTML, CSS, JS, Python/PHP)
						\item Dedicated App coded in Java or C++?
					\end{itemize}
				\item What technology could we use?
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Projector with touch kiosk?
						\item Virtual Reality?
						\item Projector with Kinect to enable touch features?
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 9/22/2015}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting went from 2:30pm-3:30pm
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting began by discussing with Morgan our reservations with having a VR component in the project. 
		\item Morgan demonstrated some of the tech, however, and it was persusive. We decided to run the idea by 
		the dean at our next meeting, and see if he thinks it would be sufficient for what he's looking for. 
	\end{itemize}
	
\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 9/29/2015}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Meeting went from 2:30 - 3:30
	\item Meeting was Joe and Ronnie looking up good projectors for this project, along with prices. 
	\item Joe found a fantastic short-throw projector that would be ideal for our purposes. Details are in the spec sheet. 
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 10/19/2015}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Meeting went from 2:30 - 3:30
	\item Meeting focused almost entirely on Joe and Ronnie having a conversation with the co-founder of UBI Interactive. 	\item As expected, UBI Interactive seems to be exactly the kind of thing we're looking for on this project. The demonstration went very well. UBI is fast, responsive, and easy to set-up and use. 
	\item After the conversation, Joe showed the team exactly where the screen would be installed. It will be on the eastern wall, because this wall already has convenient rear access via a service closet. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 11/2/2015}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Meeting went from 2:30 - 3:30
	\item Joe updated us on the status of the Wiki. 
	\item Joe demonstrated some 3D menu ideas he's been toying around with. 
	\item We talked about how to best layout the screen as far as how many tiles, and decided it would be best to optimize the number and layout of the tiles to support up to 3 users. 
	\item Action items for this week are to come up with some potential art designs, to research the possibility of integrating Google Maps into our app, and to put more work into splitting the screen into multiple parts for multiple users. 
\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Meeting Notes for Tuesday 11/17/2015}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting Time:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 2:30pm - 3:45pm
		\end{itemize}
		\item Goals for the Previous Sprint:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Morgan: Research how we can split the user interface effectively into 3 separate, but fully functional entities.
			\item Ronnie: Research what would be necessary to incorporate an interactive Google Maps component into the project. 
			\item Joe: Work on some potential art designs for how the app may eventually look. 
		\end{itemize}
		\item What was accomplished?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Morgan: Completed and demonstrated a rough demo showing it would be a fairly simple task to make it so the interface could be divided into three separately functioning modules. The source code was put on the github repo. Morgan also demonstrated a side project he had worked on, which can best be described as an easy-to-use graphical Unity interface builder that, when completed, will make it so down the line, when someone (faculty, deans, etc.) want to update their information, they can do so very easily without messing up the way the app functions. 
			\item Ronnie: Discovered an already built and well-reviewed asset in the Unity store that incorporates an interactable Google Maps into an object. This asset is ready to go off-the-shelf, and would be a massive time saver versus rolling an asset ourselves. The asset is a steal at 60 dollars, and the team has agreed that we should purchase it and incorporate it into our project. 
			\item Joe: Made some mock-ups of potential user interface elements that incorporate images, titles, and symbols. Joe also worked on the wiki for our project. 
		\end{itemize}
			\item What was discussed at the meeting?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The three of us demonstrated the things we accomplished during the last sprint (as laid out above).
			\item We met with Larry Stauffer.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Larry mostly wanted to discuss his desire to implement speakers into the kiosk. 
					\item What kind of speakers? (Studio monitors, computer speakers, surround sound, etc.)
		  			\item How many speakers?
					\item Where would the speakers be placed?
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
			 \item What needs to be accomplished in the next sprint?
				 \begin{itemize}
				 	\item Morgan: Continue working on the graphical interface builder.
				 	\item Ronnie: Begin research and/or start preliminary coding of web scraping and info serialization for the app. 
				 	\item Joe: Make more art mock-ups and get the ball rolling on buying everything we need to get started with actual development. 
				 \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

After researching integrating google maps into our project, I found a free Unity3D asset that uses static images from google maps, but I doubt that would be sufficient. 

There is, however, a fantastic looking asset that actually does integrate fully interactive maps from google maps, which seems like exactly what we need.

This asset is $60, but seems to be well worth it. There is a video in this folder demonstrating the use of this asset.
